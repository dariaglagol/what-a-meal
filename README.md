Hello! 
This is a pet project and, in the future, cookbook application. 

Now it's just a search bar with list of recipes. You may search by meal or grocery.

**What's "the future"?**

* Add grocery items from your fridge as a chips, then have a look what you could cook!
* Need to buy something more? Just copy list of rests!
* Have favorite recipe? Save it!
