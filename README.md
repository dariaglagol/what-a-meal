Hello! 
This is a pet project and, in the future, useful cookbook application. 

Now it's just a search bar with list of recipies. You may search by meal or grocery.

What's "the future"?

Add grocery items from your fridge as a chips, then have a look what you could cook!
Need to buy something more? Just copy list of rests!
Have favorite recipe? Save it!
